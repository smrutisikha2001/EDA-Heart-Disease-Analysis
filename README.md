Below is the detailed list of columns present in the dataset:

-> age (in years)

-> sex
(1 = male; 0 = female)

	Value 0: typical angima
	Value 1: atypical angima
	Value 2: non-angimal pain
	Value 3: asymptomatic

->trestbps: resting blood pressure 
resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

->chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl

->fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl(1 = true; 0 = false)

->restcg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
	Value 0:normal
	Value 1:having ST-T wave abnormality 
	Value 2:showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by 		Estes' criteria

->thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

->exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

-> oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

->slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
	Value 1: upsloping
	Value 2: flat
	Value 3: downsloping

-> ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

-> thal: 1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect 

-> target = the presence of heart disease in the patient. 
It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
